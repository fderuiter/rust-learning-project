## **Conclusion**

This project plan outlines a comprehensive, phased approach to building a 'Mario 64-Style Face Stretcher' using Rust and WebAssembly. The architectural decisions detailed herein are founded on a strategic understanding of the modern web technology landscape. By adopting a **Two-Stack Architecture**, we leverage the distinct strengths of Rust/Wasm for high-performance computation and Three.js for robust, feature-rich rendering. This pragmatic approach focuses engineering effort on the project's unique challenges—the custom physics simulation—while avoiding the unnecessary complexity of re-implementing solved problems.

The selection of **Trunk** as the application bundler further reinforces a commitment to developer velocity and an integrated, streamlined workflow. Finally, the **two-tiered testing strategy** ensures both the algorithmic correctness of the core Rust logic and the integrity of the critical Wasm-to-JavaScript interface.

By following this plan, the development team can proceed with confidence, equipped with a clear roadmap that mitigates risks, optimizes resource allocation, and is designed to deliver a high-quality, performant, and engaging web application. The resulting project will not only achieve its immediate functional goals but will also serve as a powerful case study for the effective and mature use of WebAssembly to augment modern web experiences.
